        <p class="ap" style="margin-left: 40px;">
            Over the last decade, Manan has planned and executed hundreds of events ranging from large-scale conventions
            to themed
            holiday parties to intimate networking dinners and everything in between. His creativity, attention to
            detail,
            organizational skills and passion for planning ensures the success of every celebration he’s a part of.

            Manan began her career working at the Hayatt Hotel, the largest hotel in Nepal, where he realized his love
            for planning, logistics, and all the little details that make a spectacular event. From there, he was
            recruited by the
            Director of Employee Programs at Partners HealthCare, where he planned corporate and employee recognition
            events for
            almost ten years.

            In 2013, Manan became the owner of Destiny Events and given his extensive background in corporate events,
            he shifted
            the company’s focus to corporate events. Manan is a proud Certified Meeting Professional (CMP), a
            credential and
            distinction of excellence in today’s meetings, conventions and exhibitions industry.
